# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to create a new GitHub repository and push your code:

## 1. Create a new repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner, then select "New repository"
3. Set the repository name to "bulls"
4. Add a description: "Bulls Bikes Inventory Management App"
5. Leave it as a Public repository
6. Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Connect your local repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show instructions. Follow the second option "â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line".

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bulls.git
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Verify your repository

1. Refresh the GitHub page
2. You should now see all your code on GitHub
3. The README.md will be displayed on the repository's home page

## 4. Deploy the application (optional)

You can deploy your application using GitHub Pages, Firebase Hosting, or another hosting service of your choice.

### Firebase Hosting (recommended)

Since this application already uses Firebase for authentication and database, Firebase Hosting is a natural choice:

1. Make sure Firebase CLI is installed:
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. Login to Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. Navigate to the app directory:
   ```bash
   cd bulls-app
   ```

4. Initialize Firebase Hosting:
   ```bash
   firebase init hosting
   ```
   - Select your Firebase project
   - Specify "build" as your public directory
   - Configure as a single-page app
   - Don't overwrite index.html

5. Deploy to Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```
